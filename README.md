# AI-Generated-Imagery-with-Stable-Diffusion
<h2> Objective : </h2>
This project utilizes the power of the Stable Diffusion model to generate high-quality, detailed images from text prompts. By leveraging pre-trained models such as Dreamlike Diffusion and custom prompts.<br>

## Features

- **AI-Generated Imagery**: Generate images from text descriptions using Stable Diffusion.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Use your own descriptive prompts for tailored image creation.
- **High-Quality Renderings**: Produce high-quality images with customizable parameters like inference steps and the number of generated images.
- **Versatile Scenes**: Create a variety of images, including dreamlike serene scenes or intense warzone settings.

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch (with GPU support)
- Diffusers
- Matplotlib
- Transformers (for Hugging Face integration)
